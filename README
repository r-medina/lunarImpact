MATLAB utility for simulating a lunar impact with a satellite.

See Lunar_Impact_Project.pdf for project description.

See report/prelimReport.pdf and report/finalReport.pdf for detailed
descriptions of my code, logic, and work. The contents of data/ are
more or less described in there.

Because I reorganized the directory structure, I recompiled the PDFs
from LaTeX with the proper paths and the dates are wrong. The
preliminReport was completed on March 15, 2011 and the finalReport was
completed on March 22, 2011.
